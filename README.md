# MLPerf Inference Test Bench

**M**LPerf **I**nference **T**es**t** B**en**ch, or Mitten, is a framework by NVIDIA to run the [MLPerf Inference
benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference).


## Features

Mitten, while more optimized for NVIDIA GPU-based systems, is a generic framework that supports arbitrary systems. Some
of the things that Mitten handles are:

- System Detection
- Benchmark Configuration
- SUT Harnesses running as a separate executable
